### Express the function n^3/1000 - 100n^2 - 100n + 3

(1/1000)(n^3) - (100)(n^2) - (100)(n) + 3

We disregard all terms but the highest one:
(1/1000)(n^3)

We get rid of the constant factor and we end up with:
O(n^3)

### Consider linear search again. How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in O-notation? Justify your answers.

If every element is equally likely to be the answer, and the value being
searched is in the list, then we'll check n/2 in average, or: (1/2)n we
disregard the constant factor and leave only n, thus O(n).

The worst case scenario happens when the value is not found in the array,
then we have to check every one of them, the we have that the order of
growth is O(n).

Both of them are the same.

### How can we modify almost any algorithm to have a good best-case running time.

Add a special check if the best-case scenario is found and handle it
accordingly.
