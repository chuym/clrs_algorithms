    <h1>Exercise 2.3-4 from chapter 2 - Getting started</h1>
    <p>
      We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort \(A[1..n]\), we recursively sort \(A[1..n-1]\) and then insert \(A[n]\) into the sorted array \(A[1..n-1]\). Write a recurrence for the worst-case running of this recursive version of insertion sort
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst case scenario for insertion sort happens when the array is already sorted, because \(A[n]\) will be \(A[n]\geq{A[n-1]}\) and then has to iterate over all elements in \(A[1..n]\), which we can easily deduct the complexity to be \(\Theta(n^2)\)</br>
      With this in mind, then:

      $$
      I(n) = \begin{cases}
        1, & \text{if \(n = 1 \)}. \\
        I(n-1) + C(n - 1), & \text{if \(n > 1\)}.
      \end{cases}
      $$
