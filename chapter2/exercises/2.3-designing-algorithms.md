### Using figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on the array A = [3,41,52,26,38.57,9,49].

    a) [3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49]
    b) [3, 41, 52, 26] <-> [38, 57, 9, 49]
    c) [3, 41] <-> [52, 26] <--> [38, 57] <-> [9, 49]
    d) [3] <-> [41] <--> [52] <-> [26] <---> [38] <-> [57] <--> [9] <-> [49]
    e) [3, 41] <-> [26, 52] <--> [38, 57] <-> [9, 49]
    f) [3, 26, 41, 52] <-> [9, 38, 49, 57]
    g) [3, 9, 26, 38, 41, 49, 52, 57]
