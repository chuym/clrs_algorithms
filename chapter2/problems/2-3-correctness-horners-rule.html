    <h1>Problem 2-3 - Correctness of Horner's rule</h1>
    <p>
      The following code fragment implements Horner's rule for evaluating a polynomial
      $$
      \begin{align}
      P(x) &= \sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k \\
      &= a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + \ldots + x(a_{n-1} + xa_n) \ldots))
      \end{align}
      $$
      given the coefficients \(a_0, a_1, \ldots , a_n\) and a value for \(x\):
      <pre class="tex2jax_process">
        y = 0
        for i = n downto 0
            y = \(a_i + x \cdot y\)
      </pre>
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>In terms of \(\Theta\)-notation, what is the running time of this code framgnet for Horner's rule?</strong>
        <p>
          The running time is \(\Theta(n)\)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Write pseudocode to implement the naive polynomial-evaluation algorithm that computes each term of the polynomial from scratch. What is the running time of this algorithm? How does it compare to Horner's rule?</strong>
        <p>
          <pre class="tex2jax_process">
            sum = 0
            for i = n downto 0
                y = 1
                    for j = n downto 1
                        y = x * y
                sum = sum + \(a_0 \cdot y\)

          </pre>
          The running time of this algorithm is \(\Theta(n^2)\) it has a greater order of growth than Horner's rule. This is mainly because we are repeatedly calculating powers of \(x\).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Consider the following loop invariant: </br>
        At the start of each iteration of the <strong>for</strong> loop of lines 2-3,
        $$
        y = \sum_{k=0}^{n-(i+1)} a_{k+i+1}x^k
        $$
        Interpret a summation with no terms as equaling 0. Following the structure of the loop invariant proof presented in this chapter, use this loop invariant to show that, at termination, \(y = \sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k\).
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> At the beginning of the iteration, the sum is 0 because the summation has no terms.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Before each iteration, we have:
              $$
              y = \sum_{k=0}^{n-(i+1)} a_{k+i+1}x^k
              $$
              Then, we calculate the next term in the series and add it to the summation:
              $$
              \begin{align}
                y &= a_i + x \sum_{k=0}^{n-(i+1)} a_{k+i+1}x^k \\
                &= a_i + \sum_{k=0}^{n-(i+1)} a_{k+i+1}x^{k+1} \\
                &= \sum_{k=-1}^{n-(i+1)} a_{k+i+1}x^{k+1} \\
              \end{align}
              $$
              Next, we define \(k' = k + 1\), to denote the fact we have summated the term, then we have:
              $$
              y = \sum_{k'=0}^{n-(i+1)} a_{k'+i}x^{k'}
              $$
              Next, we decrement i, as per the <strong>for</strong> \(i' = i - 1\), then we have:
              $$
              y = \sum_{k'=0}^{n-(i'+1)}a_{k'+i'+1}x^{k'}
              $$

              Which let us hold the invariant for the next iteration of the loop
            </li>
            <li><strong>Termination:</strong> The <strong>for</strong> loop ends when \(i = -1\), if we substitute the values:
              $$
              \begin{align}
                y &= \sum_{k=0}^{n-(i+1)} a_{k+i+1}x^k \\
                &= \sum_{k=0}^{n-(-1+1)} a_{k-1+1}x^k \\
                &= \sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k
              \end{align}
              $$
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Conclude by arguing that the given code fragment correctly evaluates a poly-nomial characterized by the coefficients \(a_0, a_1, \ldots , a_n\).
        <p>
          The code fragment evaluates: \(a_i + x \cdot y \), where \(y\) is the sum of the terms evaluated down from \(n\) to \(i + 1\). Which is equivalent to the proof shown above. We know that the loop terminates when \(i = -1 \), at which point we'll have the sum of all terms in our polynomial: \(\sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k\)
