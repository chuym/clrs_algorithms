    <h1>Exercise 5.2.1</h1>
    <h2>
      In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you hire exactly one time? What is the probability that you hire exactly $n$ times?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Given that there are $n!$ ways that $n$ candidates can be ordered and that the event, when we hire exactly once, $E$, happens when the best candidate is on the first position, then we have $(n - 1)!$ possibilities where the best candidate is placed first, then the probability of hiring exactly once is:
      \begin{align}
      Pr\{E\} &= \frac{(n-1)!}{n!} \\
      Pr\{E\} &= \frac{1}{n}
      \end{align}
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the event when we hire $n$ times $W$, happens only when the order of the candidates is in ascending order, then
      $$
      Pr\{W\} = \frac{1}{n!}
      $$
