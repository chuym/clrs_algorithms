    <h1>Exercise 5.3.3</h1>
    <h4>
      Suppose that instead of swapping element $A[i]$ with a random element from the subarray $A[i..n]$, we swapped it with a random element from anywhere in the array:
    </h4>
    <pre>
      n = A.length
      for i = 1 to n
        swap A[i] with A[RANDOM(1, n)]
    </pre>
    Does this code produce a uniform random permutation? Why or why not?
    <p>
      We know that an the array $A[n]$ has $n!$ possible permutations, in order to produce an uniform permutation, the procedure must generate $n!$ permutations (or a multiple of it) with all possibilities equally likely. This procedure can generate $n^n$ permutations, which is far higher than $n!$, except when $n = 1$, where they are the same - but generating permutations for an array of length 1 doesn't make sense anyway.
