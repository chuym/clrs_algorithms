    <h1>Exercise 5.3.4</h1>
    <h4>
      Profssor Armostrong suggest the following procedure for generating a uniform random permutation:
    </h4>
    <pre>
      n = A.length
      let B[1..n] be a new array
      offset = RANDOM(1, n)
      for i = 1 to n
        dest = 1 + offset
        if dest > n
          dest = dest - n
        B[dest] = A[i]
      return B
    </pre>
    Show that each element A[i] has $1/n$ probability of winding up in any particular position in $B$. Then show that Professor Armostrong is mistaken by showing that the resulting permutation is not uniformly random.
    <p>
      Any element $A[i]$ has $1/n$ probability of winding up in any particular position in $B$ because all elements in $A[i]$ are equally likely to be put in any $B[1..n]$ position - $dest$ is not calculated with any bias towards $i$ on each cycle.<br>
    </p>
    The resulting permutation is not uniform because dest will cycle and will be the same values for all iterations.
