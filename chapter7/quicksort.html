        What is the running time of Quicksort when all elements of array $A$ have the same value?
        <br>
        <p>
          When all values in the Array are the same, this means that Partition will generate two arrays, one of them empty and the second one of length A'[A.length - 1]. After that, each subsequent partition will generate a new array that one of them is empty and the other is A''[A'.length - 1]. Thus, the running time will be $\Theta(n^2)$
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          Show that the running time of Quicksort is $\Theta(n^2)$ when the array A contains distinct elements and is sorted in decreasing order.
          <br>
          <p>
              Assume we have $A = {4, 3, 2 , 1 }$. Calling partition on A will modify A as follows:
              <pre>
1. {4, 3, 2, 1}
2. {4, 3, 2, 1}
3. {4, 3, 2, 1}
4. {1, 4, 3, 2}
              </pre>
              The subset of elemeents lower than A[r] is empty, while the subset of elements greater htan A[r] are all the elements except A[r] itself: $A' = {4, 3, 2 }$ - Thus, subsequent calls to a descending order array will yield similar subsets, thus the run time of $\Theta(n^2)$

          Banks often record transactions on an account in order of the times of the transactions, but many people like to receive their bank statements with checks listed in order by check number. People usually write checks in oder by check number, and merchants usuall cash them with reasonable dispatch. The problem of converting time-of-transaction ordering to check-number ordering is therefore the problem of sorting almost-sorted input. Argue that the procedure INSERTION-SORT would tend to beat the proceure QUICKSORT on this problem.
          <br>
          <p>
              This is rationale can be easily concluded if you analyse the best and worst case scenarios for insertion sort and quicksort respectively. Insertion sort's best case happens when the array is already sorted, because no changes are required on the array and will run in $\Theta(n)$. On the contrary, the worst case scenario for quicksort is when the array is already sorted, because arrays generated by Partition will be unbalanced, where one of the arrays will be empty and the second one will be of length $A.length - 1$, which will yield a running time of $\Theta(n^2)$
              Then, if the average problem consists of an almost-sorted array, we can conclude that the average case for these problems will tend to lean towards the best case scenario for insertion sort and for the worst case scenario of quicksort.

          Suppose that the splits at every level of quicksort are in the propotion of $1 - \alpha$ to $\alpha$, where $0 \lt \alpha \leq 1/2$ is a constant. Show that the minimum depth of a leaf in the recursion tree is approximately $\text{lg }n / \text{lg }\alpha$ and the maximum depth is approximately $\text{lg }n / \text{lg}(1 - \alpha)$.

            The following gives the depth $d$ for the 'left-side'
            \begin{align}
              n\alpha^d &\leq 1 \\
              \alpha^d &\leq \frac{1}{n} \\
              d &\leq \text{log}_\alpha\frac{1}{n} \\
              d &\leq \text{log}_\alpha 1 - \text{log}_\alpha n && \text{Applying logarithmic rules}\\
              d &\leq -\text{log}_\alpha n \\
              d &\leq -\frac{\text{lg}n}{\text{lg}\alpha} && \text{Changed log base to 2, hence lg}
            \end{align}

            The following will give the depth $d$ for the 'right-side'

            \begin{align}
              n(1 - \alpha)^d &\leq 1 \\
              (1 - \alpha)^d &\leq \frac{1}{n} \\
              d &\leq \text{log}_{(1 - \alpha)}\frac{1}{n} \\
              d &\leq \text{log}_{(1 - \alpha)} 1 - \text{log}_{(1 - \alpha)} n && \text{Applying logarithmic rules}\\
              d &\leq -\text{log}_{(1 - \alpha)} n \\
              d &\leq -\frac{\text{lg}n}{\text{lg}(1 - \alpha)} && \text{Changed log base to 2, hence lg}
            \end{align}
